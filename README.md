# InvokeRepeating
 
This is a essentially a clone of the utility function contained within the Unity engine, [InvokeRepeating](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.InvokeRepeating.html). This is a useful function whenever you want to call a function to do something every x seconds. This utility function, invoke_repeating, will itself invoke a function in wait_time seconds (delay), then repeatedly every repeat_rate seconds. 

The function is a method contained in a Utiliy class to easily be expanded into other helpful utility functions. There is an example scene which demonstrates how the invoke_repeating function works. 

[Based on and inspired by a YouTube video created by Blargis.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56I72m5wDj4) I highly recommend watching this video for a deeper understanding of how this works. The video also demonstrates how functional GDScript is with first-class functions and lamdas.
